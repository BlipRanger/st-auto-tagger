# SillyTavern Auto Tagger

SillyTavern Auto Tagger is an extension aimed at facilitating quick tagging of cards. Currently it pulls tags and optionally creator info from [CHUB](https://www.chub.ai/about). 
Future sources of tags, including LLM based character tag analysis are planned. 

## Features
- Leverages a [Dice Coefficient](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algorithm_Implementation/Strings/Dice's_coefficient) based matching method that allows the system to identify and match modified cards.
- Seemlessly integrates into the existing tag importing system.
- Provides the option to import the tagline into the creator's notes field.

## Installation and Usage

Utilize SillyTavern's third party extension importer.
